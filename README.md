STM32F051 Discovery Board Setup

Overview

This repository provides a guide to setting up the environment for the hardware part of a project using the STM32F051 Discovery Board. The project was initially required to be created using STM32CubeMX and Keil, but for convenience, STM32CubeIDE was used instead. The setup includes peripheral initialization for UART.

Requirements

STM32F051 Discovery Board

STM32CubeMX (latest version recommended)

Keil uVision or STM32CubeIDE

USB cable for programming/debugging

UART terminal software (e.g., PuTTY, Tera Term)

Setup Instructions

Install STM32CubeMX from ST official website.

Install Keil uVision or STM32CubeIDE, depending on preference.

Create a new project in STM32CubeMX:

Select the STM32F051 Discovery Board.

Configure UART peripheral using CubeMX.

Generate the project code for Keil or STM32CubeIDE.

Open the generated project in the chosen IDE and implement the required application logic.

Build and flash the firmware to the STM32F051 board.

Open a UART terminal and verify communication.
